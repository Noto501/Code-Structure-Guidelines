## Introduction
---
These coding standards have been created to:
- Make software easier to understand
- Make software easier to update/maintain
- Reduce the frequency of software compile/runtime errors.


## Project Structure
---
Timed based Model:
- **Autonomous folder** contains files related to controling a robot during autonomous phase of a match.

- **DataLogger folder** contains files related to the datacollection of specfic variables for debuggging and tunning of the robot.

- **Mechanisms Folder** contains files related to the operation of each of the robot mechanisms. 

    Mechcanism: A mechanical subsystem used to perform an operation of a robot. (ie Drivetrain allows the robot to move on a gamefield)

- **Robot Folder** contains files related to controling the main robot code loop that will periodically call various robot methods to control the robot based on operator/code input
